## Who am I?

Ever since I was a child I fell in love with robots, education and communication. All that put together led me to become an active and passionate volunteer in different Tech Women Communities. I am working as software developer in Ekumen [Ekumen Website](https://www.ekumenlabs.com/) and I am a teacher in a Technical High School [ETRR](http://www.tecnicarobertorocca.edu.ar/)

## Goals :
- To support skills development for underrepresented talent
- To make sure organizations of the need for programs and practices that will engage young women who choose STEM fields
- To support tech women communities
- To offering valuable mentoring opportunities
