# STEM-Iniciatives
The STEM education fosters creativity and divergent thinking alongside fundamental disciplines. It motivates and inspires young people to generate new technologies and ideas. Industry support for STEM iniciatives can build bridges to reduce gaps. This list shows and makes visible non-profit communities that volunteer and offer free training to their community in person or virtually or offer scholarships for underrepresented groups in STEM areas.

## Who am I?

Ever since I was a child I fell in love with robots, education and communication. All that put together led me to become an active and passionate volunteer in different Tech Women Communities. I am working as software developer in [Ekumen](https://www.ekumenlabs.com/) and I am a teacher at  [Roberto Rocca Technical High School](http://www.tecnicarobertorocca.edu.ar/).

- To support skills development for underrepresented talent
- To make organizations aware of the need for programs to engage young women who choose STEM fields
- To support tech women communities
- To offer valuable mentoring opportunities
