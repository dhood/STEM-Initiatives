# Why memes?
Humor as a communication tool not only helps to channel our thoughts, emotions, it is liberating and powerful. Memes are a cultural abbreviation that, like all forms of communication, evolve with those who use them. No one can claim to know or understand all the memes out there. There are simply too many and they are diverse.
Feel free to generate a meme with this page about things that you have heard absurd or things that you think are necessary to be communicated Website https://www.crearmemes.es/
